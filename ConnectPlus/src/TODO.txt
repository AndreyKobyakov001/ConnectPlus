1. Fix board overflow error on inserting the last piece, such as the third piece in the first column in a 3x3 grid: DONE
[X] ? ?
 X O ?
 X O ?
 fails. This is wrong.

2. Fix the horizontal checker: DONE
? ? ? ? ? ? ?
O ? ? ? ? ? ?
O ? ? ? ? ? ?
O ? ? ? ? ? ?
O ? ? ? ? ? ?
X X X X ? ? ?
Player O wins!
WRONG for WinPieces = 4.

3. Fix diagonal checkers:DONE (in theory)
? ? ? ? ?
? ? ? ? ?
? ? X ? ?
X X O O ?
X O O X ?
WRONG for WinPieces = 3.

4. Add fail-safes for wrong characters: don't crash the program, but insist that the player try again.

5. Add settings.txt to save length, width, and win condition

6. Add A player-vs-bot mode, where a player can face off a bot of varying difficulty from 1 to 10,
where 1 is a completely random move selector and 10 is a minmax algorithm designed to win.

7. Undo button, allowing up to a preselected number of undos per game

8. Better game-saving system

9. Function ELO calculation based on games plays and moves to win, relative to opponent moves. Bots will always add or take
BOT_DIFFICULTY * PIECESCONNECTED - MOVESTOWIN - UNDOS or something like that. Opponents will follow a similar calculation,
with ELODIFF * PIECESCONNECTED - MOVESTOWIN - UNDOS or something similar.

10. Make the statistics actually change instead of being the defaults
