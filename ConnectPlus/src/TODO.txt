USE CASES:
i. Wrong user name or password on sign in
ii. Wrong password verification on account creation
iii. Account exists on account creation
iv. Invalid move in a game
v. Can't log-out if not logged in? (This should already be dealt with)
vi. Attempting an undo when already done
vii. Pieces to connect must be <= length and height, though this should be done by default
viii. Winning in all possible configurations: both players 1 and 2, and the bot, on verticals, horizontals, diagonals,
etc., particularly in literal edge cases: when victory is granted in a corner. Test also game progressions, such as the
typical outwards pattern:
                                    ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
                                    ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
                                    ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
                                    ? ? ? O ? ? ?
                                    ? ? X X O ? ?
                                    ? ? O X X O ?

7. Add limit to number of undoes

9. Improve ELO calculator

15. Make user functions screen: an option to reset user statistics, delete accounts, change passwords, and the like.
 Possibly limit the number of resets to 0, to avoid ELO changing?

16. IMPORTANT: migrate user stats to a class, that they might be more elegant. A single function to quickly transfer
all data and then put that in a class identified by username, such as user.gamesWon, would be much more effective.
