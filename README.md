# ConnectPlus
We are Group Number 36, and we have developed ConnectPlus: a novel way to play piece-connecting games!
Inspired by the popular board game Connect-4, which has 2 players connecting 4 pieces in a row on a 7-by-6 grid, we have decided to take that to the next level: our approach allows for variable board sizes from 3x3 to 10x10 (and anything in between!) and between 2 and 9 pieces connected to win. 
Users can sign in via Facebook, and either play against a friend, or against a bot of variable difficulty powered by a machine learning algorithm that implements mini-max. 
Users can also share the results of their games, and check statistics like the games they've won and lost, and their rating!

 This project was developed by Andrey Kobyakov, Law Kieu, and Chris Giannoulis for CSC207 using Java.
