# ConnectPlus
The problem domain our team is working in is Entertainment and more specifically a game.
Connect Plus is a spin-off of the original game Connect Four, where players are now able to customize the style of the game to their desires!
Players would be able to adjust board sizes as well as how many chips connected are required for a win allowing for varying ways to play the game.
